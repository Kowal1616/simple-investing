# SIMPLE INVESTING - portfolio comparison tool
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
**TODO** - should at least be several hundred words that describe things in detail! 750 words is likely to be sufficient???

I have developed a Flask App that aims at promotion of low-cost, low-maintans, long-term investing (Boggleheads style!). My app's main feature is a table which displays long term returns of chosen etfs based portfolios over 5, 10, 20 and 30 years periods. A comparison table is fed with extended historical data (enhaced with corresponding indexes and simulations) and up to date thanks to monthly performed updates from two independent data sources.

##### **Step-by-step - Process explained**

1. App is set to fetch data (etfs prices) from two different online sources (one via API, one via library).
2. A db table storing historical prices is appended with new data. To reach 30 years history I have extanded etfs historical returns with indexes and at some cases simulated results based od avarage long term returns.
3. Etfs annual yeilds are computed and updated to the db.
4. Portfolios annual uields are computed (based on etfs yields) and updated to the db.
5. Inflation cumulative rates are computed for 5, 10, 20 and 30 years periods. Those are updated to the db.
6. Portfolios historical results are computed to be later used to compute max drawdowns (biggest loss in set period of time - good indicator to show investment risk) over set periods of time (5, 10, ...). Those are updated to the db.

##### **Re 1:**

This process is triggered once on a startup and than once a month via scheduler (monthly data is used). When data from both sources is available it's using the avarage of both. Whole process runs only if: 1) data for previous month isn't already present in the db, or 2) it's not the first day of the month and data might not be available yet.

I have considered adding a mechanism checking db for needed update further back in time but as the app is intended to run on the server all the time and in event of failer would be soon restarted, I dropped it as unneeded.

##### **Re 2-6:**
All functions are stored in helpers.py and called in app.py on sturtup and than once a month via scheduler.

The portfolio comperison tool (= index page table) displays data from the database. I'm using Grid.js to create the table. It makes it easy to create it simple and slick with custom sorting - exactly as I need it. I also use Bootstrap template (I link to the author in the footer of each page).
