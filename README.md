# SIMPLE INVESTING - portfolio comparison tool
### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
### Description:
**TODO** - should at least be several hundred words that describe things in detail! 750 words is likely to be sufficient???

I have developed a Flask App that aims at promotion of low-cost, low-maintains, long-term investing (Boggleheads style!). My app's main feature is a table which displays long term returns of chosen etfs based portfolios over 5, 10, 20 and 30 years periods. A comparison table is fed with extended historical data (enhaced with corresponding indexes and simulations) and up to date thanks to monthly performed updates from two independent data sources.

#### **Project structure**
In *app.py* I:
+ Initialize my flask app, SQL-Alchemy and logging
+ Define app routes
+ Call functions (see below) and set scheduler

In *helpers.py* I:
+ Define most of my app's functions

In *models.py* I:
+ Set the db
+ Define db classes

Additionally I used *csv-importer.py* - a simple script to feed the db with csv structured data before first running my app.

#### **Step-by-step - Process explained**

1. App is set to fetch data (etfs prices) from two different online sources (one via API, one via library).
2. A db table storing historical prices is appended with new data. To reach 30 years history I have extanded etfs historical returns with indexes and at some cases simulated results based od avarage long term returns.
3. Etfs annual yeilds are computed and updated to the db.
4. Portfolios annual uields are computed (based on etfs yields) and updated to the db.
5. Inflation cumulative rates are computed for 5, 10, 20 and 30 years periods. Those are updated to the db.
6. Portfolios historical results are computed to be later used to compute max drawdowns (biggest loss in set period of time - good indicator to show investment risk) over set periods of time (5, 10, ...). Those are updated to the db.
7. App is displaying chosen db data on the web page.

#### **Re 1:**
This process is triggered once on a startup and than once a month via scheduler (monthly data is used). Whole process runs only if: 1) data for previous month isn't already present in the db, or 2) it's not the first day of the month and data might not be available yet.

To minimise the lack of data I decided to use two separate sources. One of those I access via API (output in *csv* format) and the other one via open-source library (output in pandas *DataFrame* format). If data from both is available I use the avarage.

I have considered adding a mechanism checking db for needed update further back in time but as the app is intended to run on the server all the time and in event of failer would be soon restarted, I dropped it as unneeded.

#### **Re 2-6:**
All functions are stored in *helpers.py* and called in *app.py* on sturtup and than once a month via scheduler.

#### **Re 7:**
The portfolio comperison tool (= index page table) displays data from the database. `@app.route('/api/data')` is making the data available for `@app.route("/")` and on index page I use *Grid.js* library to create the table. It makes it easy to create it simple and slick with custom sorting - exactly as I need it. I also use *Bootstrap* template (I link to the author in the footer of each page).

#### **Additional features**
User can access each Portfolio and Etf profile page with additional information and link to official profile (Etfs).

#### **Error handling**
I use `Try/Except` blocks in functions that are prone to errors - working with db or external apis. In addition I set up an e-mail notification tool, so I will get notified via e-mail (using *Sendgrid*) when serious error occure. I'm also logging errors using Python's *logging* module.




:herb: I have decided to use only dark theme for my web page as it's more energy efficient.
