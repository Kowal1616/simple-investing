# SIMPLE INVESTING - portfolio comparison tool
### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
### Description:
**TODO** - should at least be several hundred words that describe things in detail! 750 words is likely to be sufficient???

I have developed a Flask App that aims at promotion of low-cost, low-maintains, long-term investing (Boggleheads style!). My app's main feature is a table which displays long term returns of chosen etfs based portfolios over 5, 10, 20 and 30 years periods. A comparison table is fed with extended historical data (enhaced with corresponding indexes and simulations) and up to date thanks to monthly performed updates from two independent data sources.

There is a similar tool for US based investors featuring US Etfs that I took inspiration of. My app is uniqe in a way that it's aimed at EU based investors and all Portfolios consist of european Etfs. First european ETF was lounched aroud 20 years ago and the Etfs I used have probably around 10-15 years history so my extended historical data add great value to final data displayed on the web page.

#### **Project structure**
In *app.py* I:
+ Initialize my flask app, SQL-Alchemy and logging system
+ Define app routes
+ Call functions (see below) and set scheduler

In *helpers.py* I:
+ Define most of my app's functions

In *models.py* I:
+ Set the db
+ Define db classes

Additionally I used *csv-importer.py* - a simple script to feed the db with csv structured data before first running my app. To reach 30 years history I have extanded etfs historical returns with indexes and at some cases simulated results based od avarage long term returns.

I intended to avoid using robust functions, trying to follow *one_function-one_purpose* principle. I have also worked hard to implement *clean-code* philosophy with clear and informative names and comments.

#### **Step-by-step - Process explained**

1. `get_etfs_data` function - App is set to fetch data (etfs prices) from two different online sources (one via API, one via library).
2. `append_etfs_prices` function - A db table storing historical prices is appended with new data. 
3. `get_etfs_yields` function and `update_etfs_yields` function - Etfs annual yeilds are computed and updated to the db. I decided to use CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) as it is really good at showing how different investments have performed over time.
4. `get_portfolio_returns` function and `update_portfolios_returns` function - Portfolios annual yields are computed (based on etfs yields) and updated to the db.
5. `get_inflation` function and `update_inflation` function - Inflation cumulative rates are computed for 5, 10, 20 and 30 years periods. Those are updated to the db.
6. `get_portfolios_results` function, `get_portfolios_drawdown` function and `update_portfolios_drawdown` function - Portfolios historical results are computed to be later used to compute max drawdowns (biggest loss in set period of time - good indicator to show investment risk) over set periods of time (5, 10, ...). Those are updated to the db.
7. App is displaying chosen db data on the web page.

#### **Re 1:**
This process is triggered once on a startup and than once a month via scheduler (monthly data is used). Whole process runs only if: 1) data for previous month isn't already present in the db, or 2) it's not the first day of the month and data might not be available yet.

To minimise the lack of data I decided to use two separate sources. One of those I access via API (output in *csv* format) and the other one via open-source library (output in pandas *DataFrame* format). If data from both is available I use the avarage.

I have considered adding a mechanism checking db for needed update further back in time but as the app is intended to run on the server all the time and in event of failer would be soon restarted, I dropped it as unneeded.

#### **Re 2-6:**
All functions are stored in *helpers.py* and called in *app.py* on sturtup and than once a month via scheduler.

#### **Re 7:**
The portfolio comperison tool (= index page table) displays data from the database. `@app.route('/api/data')` is making the data available for `@app.route("/")`. On the index page I use *Grid.js* library to create the table. It makes it easy to create it simple and slick with custom sorting - exactly as I need it. Table can be 'scrolled' to the right to access more data.

I use *Bootstrap* Cover template (I link to the author in the footer of each page).

#### **Additional features**
User can access each Portfolio and Etf profile page with additional information and link to official profile (Etfs). Those are accesible both via collapsable menu and by clicking Portfolio/Etf name in the table.

I'm also using an AI generated project logo :)

#### **Error handling**
I use `Try/Except` blocks in functions that are prone to errors - working with the db or external online data. In addition I set up an e-mail notification tool, so I will get notified via e-mail (using *Sendgrid* library) when serious errors occure. I'm also logging errors using Python's *logging* module.




:herb: I have decided to use only dark theme for my web page as it's more energy efficient.
